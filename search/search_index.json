You can then type </p> <pre><code>module show packagename\n</code></pre> <p>and it will show you the other software dependencies this module has: these have to be loaded first. It also shows where the software is installed and what environment variables it sets up.</p> <p>Once you have found the modules you want to load, it is good practice to refer to them using their full name, including the version. If you use the short form (<code>package</code> rather than <code>package/5.1.2/gnu-4.9.2</code>) then a matching module will be loaded, but if we install a different version, your jobs may begin using the new one and you would not know which version created your results. Different software versions may not be compatible or may have different default settings, so this is undesirable.</p> <p>You may need to unload current modules in order to load some requirements (eg different compiler, different MPI).</p> <p>This example switches from Intel compiler and MPI modules to GNU ones.</p> <pre><code>module unload -f compilers mpi\nmodule load compilers/gnu/4.9.2\nmodule load mpi/openmpi/3.1.4/gnu-4.9.2\n</code></pre> <p>You can use the short name when unloading things because there is usually only one match in your current modules.</p> <p>The last part of a module name usually tells you what compiler it was built with and which version  of that compiler. There may be GNU compiler versions and Intel compiler versions of the same  software available.</p> <p>Once the module is loaded, you should have all the usual executables in your path, and can use its commands. You load modules in exactly the same way inside a jobscript.</p>"},{"location":"remote-access/","title":"Remote Access to Cluster Resources","text":"<p>Computing services are accessible from inside the UCL however, if you wish to connect from outside UCL, you need to either connect via the UCL VPN or use SSH to log in to the Gateway node that is accessible from the outside and use that to \"jump\" to the required resource.</p>"},{"location":"remote-access/#connecting-to-the-gateway-node","title":"Connecting to the gateway node","text":"<p>You can connect to the jump boxes by connecting with your SSH client to:</p> <pre><code>ssh0.theory.phys.ucl.ac.uk\n</code></pre> <p>Once connected you can then log on to the theory service you wish to use using as normal.</p>"},{"location":"status-page/","title":"Cluster Status","text":""},{"location":"Clusters/Biop/","title":"Biop Docs","text":"<p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.
